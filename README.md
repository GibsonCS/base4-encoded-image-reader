# Image Measurement Extraction API and Supply Control

This project is a backend system built with Fastify and Node.js 22, integrated with Google's AI to read measurement values from base64-encoded images (e.g., analog water or gas meters). The system processes the image, extracts the value, and returns the result along with a temporary image URL. If necessary, the value can be manually corrected via a dedicated endpoint.

## Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Node.js v22+
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- docker

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GibsonCS/gibson_shopper.git
cd gibson_shopper
docker-compose up --build measurement-api
```
obs: you need a .env file. Vide .env.example
This will build the image (if necessary) and start the application inside a container. By default, the server will be available on port 80 (container: 3000).

## üß™ Testing with Docker

Run unit tests
To run unit tests inside the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm test
```

This will create a temporary container based on the test service defined in your docker-compose.yml, run the tests, and remove the container afterward.
